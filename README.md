# YouTube Data Analysis Project

This project leverages the YouTube Data API to fetch, analyze, and visualize insights from YouTube channels and videos. The goal is to explore trends, identify key metrics, and showcase data visualization techniques using Python.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Retrieve video and channel statistics using the YouTube Data API.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate visual insights with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilize NLTK and WordCloud for text analysis on video titles and descriptions.
- **Customizable Analysis**: Focus on specific channels or topics by modifying channel IDs.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **APIs**: Google API Python Client, YouTube Data API
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Handling: Pandas
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
  - NLP: NLTK
- **Other Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook for an interactive coding environment

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Obtain your YouTube API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
4. Replace the placeholder API key (`api_key`) in the code with your own.
5. Modify the `channel_id` variable to analyze specific YouTube channels.
6. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Visual Outputs
The project generates:
- Line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps for data insights.
- Word clouds summarizing key video or channel-related terms.

## Next Steps
- Automate data collection for multiple channels.
- Incorporate sentiment analysis for comments.
- Enhance visualizations with interactive dashboards.
